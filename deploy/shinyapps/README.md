# LibeR shinyapps.io launchers

These minimal launchers deploy the package GUIs without embedding source code
or credentials in the application bundle.

- **LibeRation** uses a separate ephemeral project workspace for every browser
  session and disables its background local queue. Estimation and simulation
  therefore execute in the Shiny worker process.
- **LibeRality** starts with its synthetic teaching design and keeps its state
  within the browser session.
- **LibeRator** opens without an access password and creates a separately
  encrypted ephemeral workspace for every browser session. Its random managed
  key exists only in that server session and its files are removed when the
  session ends. It must only be used with synthetic teaching data on
  shinyapps.io.

The applications must not be used as durable or clinical data stores. Connect
them to governed persistent infrastructure before enabling real study or
patient data.

Hosted deployments use a dedicated GitHub-sourced package library outside the
source checkout. Prepare or refresh it with:

```r
Rscript deploy/shinyapps/prepare-library.R
```

Then validate and deploy with:

```r
Rscript deploy/shinyapps/check-manifests.R
Rscript deploy/shinyapps/test-launchers.R
Rscript deploy/shinyapps/deploy.R liberation
```

Set `LIBER_SHINYAPPS_LIBRARY` or the shared `LIBER_DEV_CACHE` when a custom
cache location is required.
