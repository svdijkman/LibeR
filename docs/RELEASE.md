# Release and source-of-truth policy

This repository root is the authoritative source for the six-package LibeR
compatibility set. Package archives, check directories, installed libraries,
benchmark outputs, user workspaces, and deployment bundles are generated
artefacts and are not source. `ecosystem.json` pins the package versions and
wire/workspace contracts released together.

The six individual package repositories are distribution mirrors. Their
default branches and tags must be generated from the corresponding monorepo
subdirectories; package-specific changes must never be committed only to a
mirror.

Every release must:

1. pass package checks on Windows, Linux, and macOS;
2. pass cross-package wire, queue, and workspace integration tests;
3. pass the browser regression suite at desktop and mobile viewport sizes;
4. publish performance only after `nm_validation_gate()` passes correctness;
5. run the scheduled NONMEM, PopED, and PFIM external validation matrix;
6. regenerate help, vignettes, manuals, source/binary archives, checksums, and
   the compatibility manifest; and
7. be tagged from the exact source commit used to build the artefacts.
8. validate and publish the ecosystem support matrix; and
9. synchronize the six package mirrors from the tagged monorepo source.

Use `Rscript tools/release.R` from a clean checkout. It refuses dirty source or
a version mismatch between package DESCRIPTION files and `ecosystem.json`,
installs all six packages into an isolated release library, checks every source
archive against that exact stack, and emits source/Windows artifacts, API
lifecycle inventory, per-package check logs, a release-evidence manifest, and
SHA-256 checksums. `LIBER_RELEASE_ALLOW_DIRTY=true` is available only for a
non-publishable development build and is recorded as such. Release notes must
name skipped external tools and must not promote experimental smoke tests to
reference validation.

After tagging and publishing the consolidated release, dry-run the mirror
synchronisation with `Rscript tools/sync-package-mirrors.R`. Publish the exact
package sources, tags, and per-package release assets with:

```text
Rscript tools/sync-package-mirrors.R --push --publish-releases
```

The command refuses a dirty tracked monorepo or an existing package tag. It
preserves repository-specific `.github` metadata while replacing every package
source file from the corresponding tagged monorepo subdirectory.

Scientific validation uses a separate immutable library named from the
consolidated release, Git commit, and dirty-source hash:

```text
Rscript tools/create-validation-library.R --source
```

Validation runners reject libraries whose package versions or recorded source
provenance do not match the current checkout.
